compilateur\nExécutez make spec pour vous assurer que toutes les spécifications passent, et vous avez tout installé correctement.\nUtilisez bin/crystal pour exécuter vos fichiers en cristal\n\nSi vous souhaitez plus d'informations sur le nouveau bin/crystal, consultez la documentation utiliser le compilateur.\nRemarque: Le binaire réel est intégré à .build/crystal, mais le script enveloppebin/crystal est-ce que vous devez utiliser pour exécuter du cristal.\n"},"using_the_compiler/":{"url":"using_the_compiler/","title":"Utiliser le compilateur","keywords":"","body":"Utiliser le

Crystal ont .cr comme extension.\nVous pouvez également utiliser la commande run:\n$ crystal run some_program.cr\nCréation d'un exécutable\nPour créer un exécutable, utilisez la commande build:\n$ crystal build some_program.cr\nCela a pour effet de créer un fichier some_program que vous pouvez exécuter:\n$ ./some_program\nNote: Par défaut les exécutables générés ne sont pas complétement optimisés.\nPour activer les optimisations, utilisez le drapeau --release:\n$ crystal build some_program.cr --release\nAssurez-vous de toujours utiliser --release pour des exécutables à distribuer ou lorsque vous faites des tests de performance.\nLes performances sans les optimisations disponibles sont plus qu'acceptables avec un temps de compilation rapide,\nvous pouvez donc exécuter la commande crystal comme si c'était un interpréteur.\nCréation d'un projet ou d'une librairie\nUtilisez la commande init pour créer un projet Crystal avec la structure de dossier standard.\n$ crystal init lib

Si le compilateur renvoie une erreur signifiant que le type d'une instance ne peut être déduit\nvous pouvez toujours ajouter une annotation de type explicite.\nLes règles suivantes ne mentionnent que les variables d'instance, mais elles s'appliquent aussi bien aux\nvariables de classe et globales. Ces règles sont les suivantes.\n1. Affecter une valeur litérale\nQuand un litéral est affecté à une variable d'instance, le type du litéral est ajouté à l'ensemble.\nTous les litéraux sont associés à un type.\nDans l'exemple qui suit, @name est déduit comme une String et @age comme un Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @name = \"John Doe\"\n    @age = 0\n  end\nend\n\nCette règle, et toutes les suivantes, seront aussi appliquées dans d'autres méthodes qu'initialize. Par exemple:\nclass SomeObject\n  def lucky_number\n    @lucky_number = 42\n  end\nend\n\nDans l'exemple suivant, @lucky_number sera déduit comme Int32 | Nil: Int32 car 42 lui a été affecté,\net Nil car il n'a pas été affecté dans toutes les méthodes initialize de la classe.\n2. Affecter le résultat de l'invocation de la méthode de classe new\nQuand une expression comme Type.new(...) est affectée à une variable d'instance,\nle type Type est ajouté à l'ensemble.\nDans l'exemple suivant, @address est déduit comme étant Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.new(\"somewhere\")\n  end\nend\n\nCela s'applique également aux types génériques.\nIci @values est déduit comme étant Array(Int32).\nclass Something\n  def initialize\n    @values = Array(Int32).new\n  end\nend\n\nNote: une méthode new peut être redéfinie par un type.\nDans ce cas le type inféré sera celui renvoyé par new,\ns'il peut être déduit en utilisant les règles suivantes.\n3. Affecter une variable qui est un argument de méthode avec une restriction de type\nDans l'exemple suivant @name est déduit comme étant une String car l'argument de méthode name a une restriction de type du type String,\net cet argument est affecté à @name.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nRemarquez que le nom de l'argument de la méthode n'est pas important, ce qui suit est tout autant valide:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(obj : String)\n    @name = obj\n  end\nend\n\nUtiliser la forme courte d'affectation d'une variable d'instance depuis un argument de méthode a le\nmême effet:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nRemarquez aussi que le compilateur ne vérifie pas si une valeur différente a été ré-affectée à l'argument de méthode:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name : String)\n    name = 1\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nDans le cas précédent, le compilateur déduit @name comme String, et renverra plus tard une erreur à la compilation,\nquand il typera complétement la méthode, déclarant que Int32 ne peut pas être affecté à une variable de type String.\nUtilisez une annotation de type explicite si @name n'est pas supposé être de type String.\n4. Affecter le résultat d'une méthode de classe qui a pour retour une annotation de type\nDans l'exemple suivant, le type de @address est inféré comme Address, car la méthode de classe Address.unknown a pour retour une annotation de type Address.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  def self.unknown : Address\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nEn fait, le code précédent n'a pas besoin de renvoyer une annotation de type self.unknown.\nLa raison est que le compilateur va aussi regarder le corps d'une méthode de classe et s'il peut appliquer une des règles précédentes\n(c'est une méthode new, ou c'est un litéral, etc.) il déduira le type de cette expression.\nAlors, ce qui précède peut simplement être écrit comme suit:\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @address = Address.unknown\n  end\nend\n\nclass Address\n  # No need for a return type annotation here\n  def self.unknown\n    new(\"unknown\")\n  end\n\n  def initialize(@name : String)\n  end\nend\n\nCette règle supplémentaire est très pratique car il est très commun d'avoir de méthodes de classe \"à la constructeur\" en plus de new.\n5. Affecter une variable qui est un argument de méthode avec une valeur par déafut\nDans l'exemple qui suit, parce-que la valeur par défaut de name est un litéral chaîne de caractères,\net qu'elle est plus tard affectée à @name, String sera ajouté à l'ensemble des types inférés.\nclass Person\n  def initialize(name = \"John Doe\")\n    @name = name\n  end\nend\n\nCela fonctionne bien sûr aussi avec la syntaxe courte:\nclass Person\n  def initialize(@name = \"John Doe\")\n  end\nend\n\nLa valeur par défaut peut aussi être une méthode Type.new(...) ou une méthode de classe avec un retour d'annotation de type.\n6. Affecter le résultat de l'invocation de la fonction lib\nParce-qu'une fonction lib doit avoir des types explicites,\nle compilateur peut utiliser le type retour lors de l'affectation à une variable d'instance.\nDans l'exemple suivant @age est déduit comme étant Int32.\nclass Person\n  def initialize\n    @age = LibPerson.compute_default_age\n  end\nend\n\nlib LibPerson\n  fun compute_default_age : Int32\nend\n\n7.

Par exemple:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  puts \"Got #{i}\"\nend\n\nCe qui précéde affiche \"Got 1\" et \"Got 2\".\nUne notation avec des accolades est aussi possible:\ntwice { |i| puts \"Got #{i}\" }\n\nUn yield peut prendre plusieurs valeurs:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y, z|\n  puts x + y + z\nend\n\n# Output: 6\n\nUn bloc peut spécifier moins que les arguments à utiliser par le yield:\ndef many\n  yield 1, 2, 3\nend\n\nmany do |x, y|\n  puts x + y\nend\n\n# Output: 3\n\nC'est une erreur que de spécifier plus d'arguments au bloc que ceux à utiliser par le yield:\ndef twice\n  yield\n  yield\nend\n\ntwice do |i| # Error: too many block arguments\nend\n\nChaque variable de bloc a le type de chaque expression du yield à cette même position. Exemple:\ndef some\n  yield 1, 'a'\n  yield true, \"hello\"\n  yield 2, nil\nend\n\nsome do |first, second|\n  # first is Int32 | Bool\n  # second is Char | String | Nil\nend\n\nLa variable de block second inclut également le type Nil car la dernière expression yield n'inclut pas de second argument.\nSyntaxe argument unique courte\nUne syntaxe courte existe pour spécifier un bloc qui reçoit un unique argument et invoque une méthode avec. Ceci:\nmethod do |argument|\n  argument.some_method\nend\n\nPeut être écrit ainsi:\nmethod &.some_method\n\nOu comme ça:\nmethod(&.some_method)\n\nCe qui précéde est simplement du sucre syntaxique et n'impacte aucunement les performances.\nLes arguments peuvent aussi bien être passés à some_method:\nmethod &.some_method(arg1, arg2)\n\nEt les opérateurs peuvent tout aussi bien être invoqués également:\nmethod &.+(2)\nmethod &.[index]\n\nValeur d'un yield\nL'expression yield elle-même a une valeur: la dernière expression du bloc. Par exemple:\ndef twice\n  v1 = yield 1\n  puts v1\n\n  v2 = yield 2\n  puts v2\nend\n\ntwice do |i|\n  i + 1\nend\n\nCe qui précéde affiche \"2\" et \"3\".\nLa valeur d'une expression yield est surtout utile pour transformer et filtrer les valeurs.\nLes meilleurs exemples sont les Enumerable#map\net les Enumerable#select:\nary = [1, 2, 3]\nary.map { |x| x + 1 }         #=> [2, 3, 4]\nary.select { |x| x % 2 == 1 } #=> [1, 3]\n\nUne méthode de tranformation factice:\ndef transform(value)\n  yield value\nend\n\ntransform(1) { |x| x + 1 } #=> 2\n\nLe résultat de la dernière expression est 2 car la dernière expression de la méthode transform est yield, dont la valeur est la dernière expression du bloc.\nRestrictions de type\nLe type du bloc dans une méthode qui utilise yield peut être restreint en utilisant la syntaxe &block. Par exemple:\ndef transform_int(start : Int32, &block : Int32 -> Int32)\n  result = yield start\n  result * 2\nend\n\ntransform_int(3) { |x| x + 2 } #=> 10\ntransform_int(3) { |x| \"foo\" } # Error: expected block to return Int32, not String\n\nbreak\nUne expression break dans un bloc fait retourner plus tôt la méthode:\ndef thrice\n  puts \"Before 1\"\n  yield 1\n  puts \"Before 2\"\n  yield 2\n  puts \"Before 3\"\n  yield 3\n  puts \"After 3\"\nend\n\nthrice do |i|\n  if i == 2\n    break\n  end\nend\n\nCe qui précéde affiche \"Before 1\" et \"Before 2\". La méthode thrice n'a pas exécuté l'expression puts \"Before 3\" à cause du break.\nbreak peut aussi accepter des arguments: ils deviennent les valeurs de retour de la méthode. Par exemple:\ndef twice\n  yield 1\n  yield 2\nend\n\ntwice { |i| i + 1 } #=> 3\ntwice { |i| break \"hello\" } #=> \"hello\"\n\nLa valeur du premier appel est 3 car la dernière expression de la méthode twice est yield,\nqui prend la valeur du bloc.

Pourtant nous ne devrions pas décliner les opportunités de ces 3% critiques.\n\nNéanmoins, si vous écrivez une programme et vous réalisez qu'écrire une version plus rapide sémantiquement équivalente requiert seulement des modifications mineures, vous ne devriez pas rater cette opportunité.\nEt assurez-vous de toujours profiler votre programme pour en connaître les goulots d'étranglement.\nPour le profilage, sous Mac OSX vous pouvez utiliser les\nInstruments du Time Profiler fournis avec Xcode.\nSous Linux, un programme qui peut profiler des programmes C/C++, comme gprof, devrait faire l'affaire.\nAssurez-vous de toujours profiler les programmes en les compilant ou les exécutant avec le drapeau --release, qui active les optimisations.\nEviter les allocations mémoires\nUne des meilleures optimisations possibles que vous pouvez apporter à un programme est d'éviter les allocations mémoires supperflues.\nUne allocation mémoire à lieu lorsque vous créez une instance d'une classe,\nqui se conclut par l'allocation de mémoire sur le tas. Créer une instance d'une struct utilise la mémoire de la pile et n'a aucun impact sur les performances.\nSi vous ne connaissez pas la différence entre la pile et le tas, assurez-vous de lire ceci.\nL'allocation sur le tas est lente, et il donne plus de travail au Ramasse-miettes car il aura à libérer cette mémoire plus tard.\nIl y a plusieurs moyens d'éviter les allocations sur le tas. La librairie standard est conçue pour vous aider en cela.\nNe créez pas de chaînes de caractères intermédiaires quand vous écrivez dans une IO\nPour afficher un nombre sur la sortie standard vous écrivez:\nputs 123\nDans beaucoup de langages de programmation ce qui se passe est que to_s, ou une méthode similaire pour convertir un objet dans sa représentation sous frome de string, sera invoquée, puis cette string sera affichée sur la sortie standard. Cela fonctionne, mais avec un bémol: une string intermédiaire est créée, sur le tas, seulement pour l'afficher puis s'en débrasser.\nCela fait appel à une allocation sur le tas et rajoute du travail au Ramasse-miettes.\nAvec Crystal, puts va invoquer to_s(io), sur l'objet, en lui passant l'IO vers laquelle écrire la représentation sous forme de string.\nAinsi, vous ne devriez jamais faire ceci:\nputs 123.to_s\ncar cela va créer une string intermédiaire. Ajoutez toujours un objet directement à une IO.\nQuand vous écrivez des types personnalisés, assurez-vous de redéfinir to_s(io), et non to_s,\net évitez de créer des strings intermédiaires dans cette méthode. Par exemple:\nclass MyClass\n  # Bon\n  def to_s(io)\n    # ajoute \"1, 2\" à IO sans créer des strings intermédiaires\n    x = 1\n    y = 2\n    io \nCette philosophie d'ajouter à une IO au lieu de retourner une string intermédiaire est présente dans d'autres APIs, comme dans les APIs JSON et YAML, où l'on doit définir des méthodes to_json(io) et to_yaml(io) pour écrire ces données directement dans une IO. Et vous devriez utiliser cette stratégie dans les définitions de vos APIS également.\nComparons le temps d'exécution:\n# io_benchmark.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nio = MemoryIO.new\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"without to_s\") do\n    io \nSortie:\n$ crystal io_benchmark.cr --release\nwithout to_s  69.71M (± 6.14%)       fastest\n   with to_s  14.68M (± 2.38%)  4.75× slower\nEt gardez à l'esprit que nous n'avons pas simplement amélioré le temps d'exécution: l'utilisation mémoire a aussi été diminuée.\nEviter de créer des objets temporaires de manière répétée\nConsidérons ce programme:\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n  if [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"].any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n    lines_with_language_reference += 1\n  end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\nLe programme précédent est fonctionnel mais à un gros probléme de performance:\nà chaque itération un nouveau tableau est créé pour [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"].\nRappelez-vous, un litéral de tableau est juste du sucre syntaxique pour créer une instance d'un tableau et lui ajouter des éléments, et ceci sera répété à chaque iération.\nIl y a deux façons de remédier à cela:\n\nUtiliser un tuple. Si vous utilisez {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"} dans le programme précédent il fonctionnera de la même manière,\nmais étant donné qu'un tuple ne met pas en jeu de la mémoire sur le tas il sera plus rapide, consommera moins de mémoire et donnera plus de chances au compilateur d'optimiser le programme.\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if {\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"}.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\nPasser le tableau en une constante.\nLANGS = [\"crystal\", \"ruby\", \"java\"]\n\nlines_with_language_reference = 0\nwhile line = gets\n if LANGS.any? { |string| line.includes?(string) }\n   lines_with_language_reference += 1\n end\nend\nputs \"Lines that mention crystal, ruby or java: #{lines_with_language_reference}\"\n\n\n\nL'utilisation de tuple est à privilégier.\nDes litéraux de tableau explicites dans les boucles est un moyen de créer des objets temporaires, mais ils peuvent aussi être créés via des appels de méthode.\nPar exemple Hash#keys retournera un nouveau tableau avec les clés à chaque fois qu'il est invoqué.\nAu lieu de cela, vous pouvez utiliser Hash#each_key, Hash#has_key? et d'autres méthodes.\nUtilisez des structs autant que possible\nSi vous déclarez votre type en tant que struct au lieu d'une class,\nla création d'une instance utilisera la pile, ce qui est moins gourmand que le tas et ne rajoute pas du travail au Ramasse-miettes.\nVous ne devriez néanmoins pas toujours utiliser de struct. Les structs sont passées par valeur, ainsi si vous en passez une à une méthode et la méthode la modifie,\nl'appelant ne verra pas ces modifications, ce qui peut être source de bugs.\nLa meilleure des choses à faire est d'utiliser uniquement des structs pour des objets immuables, surtout si elles sont petites.\nPar exemple:\n# class_vs_struct.cr\nrequire \"benchmark\"\n\nclass PointClass\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nstruct PointStruct\n  getter x\n  getter y\n\n  def initialize(@x : Int32, @y : Int32)\n  end\nend\n\nBenchmark.ips do |x|\n  x.report(\"class\") { PointClass.new(1, 2) }\n  x.report(\"struct\") { PointStruct.new(1, 2) }\nend\n\nSortie:\n$ crystal class_vs_struct.cr --release\n class  28.17M (± 2.86%) 15.29× slower\nstruct 430.82M (± 6.58%)       fastest\nItération sur les strings\nLes strings dans Crystal contiennent toujours des bytes encodés en UTF-8. UTF-8 est un encodage à longueur variable:\nun caractère peut être représenté sur plusieurs bytes, alors que les caractères en ASCII sont toujours représentés sur un seul byte.\nA cause de cela, indexer une string avec String#[] n'est pas une opération O(1), car à chaque fois les bytes ont besoin d'être décodés pour trouver le caractère à une position donnée.\nIl y a une optimisation faite par les Strings Crystal: si Crystal sait que tous les caractères de la string sont en ASCII, alors String#[] peut être implémentée en O(1). Néanmoins, ce n'est pas toujours le cas.\nPour cette raison, itérer sur une String de cette manière n'est pas optimale, et en fait c'est plus de l'ordre de O(n^2):\nstring = ...\nwhile i \nIl y a un second problème avec ce qui précéde: calculer la taille (size) d'une String est aussi lent, parce-que cela ne tient pas juste au nombre de bytes dans la string (la bytesize).\nNéanmoins, dès qu'une String calcule sa taille elle la met en cache. C'est toujours lent à cause de String#[].\nLa méthode pour faire cela est soit d'utiliser une des méthodes d'itération (each_char, each_byte, each_codepoint),\nou utiliser la struct plus bas niveau Char::Reader. Par exemple, en utilisant each_char:\nstring = ...\nstring.each_char do |char|\n  # ...\nend\n\n"},"guides/concurrency.html":{"url":"guides/concurrency.html","title":"Concurrence","keywords":"","body":"Concurrence\nConcurrence vs. Parallélisme\nLes notions de \"concurrence\" et \"parallélisme\" sont parfois confondues, mais sont différentes.\nUn système concurrent est un système en charge de plusieurs tâches, mais qu'il n'exécute pas forcément en même temps.\nImaginez que vous êtes en train de faire à manger dans la cuisine: vous épluchez un oignon, vous le mettez à frire, et alors qu'il est en train de frire\nvous épluchez une tomate, mais vous ne faites pas toutes ces choses en même temps: vous partagez votre temps entre ces différentes tâches.\nLe parallélisme reviendrait à remuer l'oignon en train de cuire d'une main tout en épluchant une tomate de l'autre main.\nAlors que vous lisez ces lignes, Crystal supporte la concurrence mais pas le parallélisme:\nplusieurs tâches peuvent être exécutées, et un peu de temps sera passé sur chacune d'elle, mais deux portions de code ne seront jamais exécutées exactement en même temps.\nUn programme Crystal s'exécute dans un seul thread du système d'exploitation, excepté le Ramasse-miettes (Garbage Collector ou GC), qui implémente un algorithme concurrent \"marquant-et-nettoyant\" (actuellement Boehm GC).\nFibers\nPour permettre la concurrence, Crystal a les fibers. Une fiber est d'une certaine manière similaire à un thread de système d'exploitation\nà la différence qu'elle est beaucoup plus légére et son exécution est gérée en interne par le processus.\nAinsi, un programme va lancer plusieurs fibers et Crystal va s'assurer de les exécuter au bon moment.\nBoucle événementielle\nPour tout ce qui est lié aux I/O il y a une boucle événementielle. Certaines opérations prenant du temps lui sont déléguées,\net pendant que la boucle événementielle attend après la fin de cette opération, le programme peut continuer à exécuter d'autres fibers.\nUn exemple simple de cela est lors de l'attente de la réception de données depuis une socket.\nCanaux\nCrystal a des canaux (Channels) inspirés de CSP.\nIls permettent de communiquer des données entre des fibers sans partage de mémoire et sans se soucier des verrous, sémaphores et autres structures spéciales.\nExécution d'un programme\nQuand un programme débute, il démarre une fiber principale qui exécutera votre code principal. De là, d'autres fibers peuvent être démarrées.\nLes composants d'un programme sont:\n\nL'ordonnanceur d'exécution (The Runtime Scheduler), en charge d'exécuter toutes les fibers au bon moment.\nLa boucle (The Event Loop), qui est simplement une autre fiber, chargée des tâches asynchrones, comme par exemple les fichiers, sockets, tubes, signaux et timers (comme lors d'un sleep).\nLes Channels, pour communiquer des données entre fibers. Le Runtime Scheduler va coordonner fibers et channels pour leur communication.\nGarbage Collector: pour nettoyer la mémoire \"plus utilisée\".\n\nUne Fiber\nUne fiber est une unité d'exécution qui est plus légère qu'un thread. C'est un petit objet qui a sa propre pile d'exécution de 8MB, ce qui est généralement affecté à un thread de système d'exploitation.\nLes fibers, à l'inverse des threads, sont collaboratives. Les threads sont pre-emptifs:\nLe système d'exploitation peut interrompre un thread à tout moment et démarrer l'exécution d'un autre.\nUne fiber doit explicitement dire au Runtime Scheduler de passer à une autre fiber. Par exemple s'il faut attendre après une I/O, une fiber va dire à l'ordonnanceur  \"Ecoute, je dois attendre après cette I/O qu'elle soit disponible, continue d'exécuter d'autres fibers et reviens vers moi\nquand cette I/O est prête\".\nL'avantage d'être collaboratif est que beaucoup de la surcharge liée au changement de contexte (changement entre les threads) n'existe plus.\nUne Fiber est beaucoup plus légère qu'un thread: même s'il lui est affecté 8MB, elle débute avec une petite pile de 4KB.\nSur une machine 64-bits cela nous laisse démarrer des millions et millions de fibers.\nDans une machine 32-bits on peut seulement lancer 512 fibers, ce qui est peu.\nMais étant donné que les machines 32-bits tendent à disparaître de plus en plus, on parie sur l'avenir, et pour l'instant nous nous focalisons sur les machines 64-bits.\nThe Runtime Scheduler\nLe scheduler a une queue composée de :\n\nDes fibers prêtes à être exécutées: par exemple quand vous lancez une fiber, elle est prête à être exécutée.\nLa boucle événementielle: qui est une autre fiber. Quand il n'y a aucune autre fiber à exécuter, la boucle évenementielle vérifie s'il y une opération asynchrone à exécuter,\npuis exécute la fiber en attente de cette opération. La boucle événementielle est actuellement implémentée avec libevent,\nqui est une abstraction d'autres mécanismes événementiels comme epoll ou kqueue.\nDes fibers qui ont délibérément demandé à attendre: obtenu avec Fiber.yield, qui signifie\n\"je peux continuer l'exécution, mais je vais te donner du temps pour exécuter d'autres fibers si tu le souhaites\".\n\nCommunication de données\nParce-que pour le moment il n'y a qu'un seul thread exécutant votre code, accéder et modifier une variable de classe depuis différentes fibers se déroulera sans problème.\nNéanmoins, dès que plusieurs threads (parallélisme) seront supportés par le langage, cela ne fonctionnera plus.\nC'est pourquoi le mécanisme recommandé pour communiquer des données est d'utiliser les canaux pour passer les messages entre threads.\nEn interne, un canal implémente tous les mécanismes de verrou pour éviter les courses aux données (data races), mais de l'extérieur vous les utilisez\ncomme primitives de communication, afin que vous (l'utilisateur) n'ayez à utiliser de verrous.\nCode exemple\nLancer une fiber\nPour lancer une fiber vous utilisez spawn avec un bloc:\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  socket.gets\n  # ...\nend\n\nspawn do\n  # ...\n  sleep 5.seconds\n  #  ...\nend\n\nIci nous avons deux fibers: une qui lit depuis une socket et l'autre qui fait un sleep.\nQuand la première fiber atteint la ligne socket.gets, cette fiber est mise en suspens,\nil est signifié à la boucle événementielle de continuer à exécuter cette fiber quand il y aura des données dans la socket, et le programme continue avec la deuxième fiber.\nCette fiber veut dormir pour 5 secondes, alors il est demandé à la boucle événementielle de continuer avec cette fiber pour 5 secondes.\nS'il n'y a aucune autre fiber à exécuter, la boucle événementielle va attendre qu'un de ces événements se produise, sans consommer de temps CPU.\nLa raison pour laquelle socket.gets et sleep se comportent comme cela est parce-que leur implémentation communique directement avec le Runtime Scheduler\net la boucle événementielle, il n'y a rien de magique à cela. En général, la librairie standard prend déjà soin de faire tout ça pour vous éviter d'avoir à le faire vous-même.\nRemarquez, néanmoins, que les fibers ne sont pas exécutées immédiatement. Par exemple:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nExécuter le code précédent va produire un affichage et sortir immédiatement.\nLa raison à cela est qu'une fiber n'est pas exécutée dès qu'elle est lancée.\nAinsi, la fiber principale, celle qui lance la fiber précédente, finit son exécution et le programme finit.\nUn moyen de résoudre cela est d'utiliser un sleep:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep 1.second\n\nCe programme va maintenant afficher \"Hello!\" durant une seconde puis sortir.\nC'est parce-que l'appel à sleep va planifier l'exécution de la fiber principale dans une seconde, puis exécuter l'autre fiber \"prête à être exécutée\",\nqui dans ce cas est la fiber précédente.\nUne autre manière de faire:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nCette fois-ci Fiber.yield va dire à l'ordonnanceur d'exécuter l'autre fiber.\nCela va afficher \"Hello!\" jusqu'à ce que la sortie standard bloque (l'appel système va nous dire que nous devons attendre avant que la sortie soit prête),\npuis l'exécution continue avec la fiber principale et le programme sort. Ici la sortie standard peut ne jamais bloquer et le programme va s'exécuter indéfiniment.\nSi nous voulons exécuter indéfiniment la fiber lancée, nous pouvons utiliser sleep sans argument:\nspawn do\n  loop do\n    puts \"Hello!\"\n  end\nend\n\nsleep\n\nBien sûr le programme précédent peut être écrit sans spawn du tout, seulement avec une boucle.\nsleep est plus utile lors du lancement de plus d'une fiber.\nLancer un appel\nVous pouvez aussi lancer un appel en passant un appel de méthode au lieu d'un bloc.\nPour comprendre pourquoi cela serait utile, voyons un exemple:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nLe programme précédent affiche \"10\" dix fois.\nLe problème est qu'il n'y a qu'une variable i à laquelle toutes les fibers se référent, et quand Fiber.yield est exécutée sa valeur est 10.\nPour résoudre cela, nous pouvons faire:\ni = 0\nwhile i (x : Int32) do\n    spawn do\n      puts(x)\n    end\n  end\n  proc.call(i)\n  i += 1\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nCela fonctionne tel quel car nous créons un Proc et nous l'invoquons en passant i, alors la valeur est copiée et la fiber lancée en reçoit une copie.\nPour éviter tout ce code, la librairie standard fournit une macro spawn qui accepte une expression d'appel et en gros la réécrit pour faire l'équivalent de ce qui précéde. En l'utilisant, on obtient:\ni = 0\nwhile i \nC'est surtout utile avec des variables locales qui changent durant des itérations.\nCela n'arrive pas avec des arguments de bloc. Par exemple, ce qui suit a le fonctionnement attendu:\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    puts i\n  end\nend\n\nFiber.yield\n\nLancer une fiber et attendre la fin de son exécution\nOn peut utiliser un channel pour cela:\nchannel = Channel(Nil).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Avant envoi\"\n  channel.send(nil)\n  puts \"Après envoi\"\nend\n\nputs \"Avant réception\"\nchannel.receive\nputs \"Après réception\"\n\nCe qui affiche:\nAvant réception\nAvant envoi\nAprès réception\n\nTout d'abord, le programme lance une fiber mais ne l'exécute pas encore. Quand nous invoquons channel.receive, la fiber principale bloque et l'exécution continue avec la fiber lancée. Ensuite channel.send(nil) est invoquée, et alors l'exécution continue à channel.receive, qui était en attente d'une valeur.\nPuis la fiber pincipale continue et s'achève, le programme sort donc sans donner à l'autre fiber de chance d'afficher \"Après envoi\".\nDans l'exemple précédent nous avons utilisé nil simplement pour communiquer que la fiber s'est terminée.\nNous pouvons aussi utiliser les canaux pour communiquer des valeurs entre fibers:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Avant le premier envoi\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Avant le second envoi\"\n  channel.send(2)\nend\n\nputs \"Avant la première réception\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 1\n\nputs \"Avant la deuxième réception\"\nvalue = channel.receive\nputs value # => 2\n\nAffichage:\nAvant la première réception\nAvant le premier envoi\n1\nAvant la deuxième réception\nAvant le second envoi\n2\n\nNotez que lorsqu'un programme exécute un receive, cette fiber bloque et l'exécution se poursuit avec l'autre fiber.\nQuand send est exécutée, l'exécution continue avec la fiber qui était en attente sur ce canal.\nIci nous envoyons des valeurs litérales, mais la fiber lancée peut calculer cette valeur, par exemple, en lisant un fichier, ou depuis une socket. Quand cette fiber devra attendre après une I/O, d'autres fibres pourront continuer à exécuter du code jusqu'à ce que cette I/O soit prête, puis finalement quand cette valeur est prête et envoyée via le canal, la fiber principale la recevra. Par exemple:\nrequire \"socket\"\n\nchannel = Channel(String).new\n\nspawn do\n  server = TCPServer.new(\"0.0.0.0\", 8080)\n  socket = server.accept\n  while line = socket.gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\nspawn do\n  while line = gets\n    channel.send(line)\n  end\nend\n\n3.times do\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nLe programme précédent lance deux fibers. La première crée un TCPServer, accepte une connexion et lit depuis des lignes, et les envoie au canal. Il y a une seconde fiber qui lit des lignes depuis l'entrée standard. La fiber principale\nlit les 3 messages qui sont envoyés sur le canal, soit depuis la socket ou stdin, puis le programme sort.\nLes appels gets vont bloquer les fibers et dire à la boucle événementielle de continuer à partir de là si des données arrivent.\nDe la même manière, nous pouvons attendre après de multiples fibers d'achever leur exécution, et de regrouper leurs valeurs:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\n10.times do |i|\n  spawn do\n    channel.send(i * 2)\n  end\nend\n\nsum = 0\n10.times do\n  sum += channel.receive\nend\nputs sum # => 90\n\nVous pouvez, bien sûr, utiliser receive depuis une fiber qui a été lancée:\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Avant envoi\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Après envoi\"\nend\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Avant réception\"\n  puts channel.receive\n  puts \"Après réception\"\nend\n\nputs \"Avant yield\"\nFiber.yield\nputs \"Après yield\"\n\nAffichage:\nAvant yield\nAvant envoi\nAvant réception\nBefore receive\n1\nAprès réception\nAprès envoi\nAprès yield\n\nIci channel.send est exécuté en premier, mais étant donné que rien n'est (encore) en attente d'une valeur, l'exécution se poursuit dans les autres fibers.\nLa seconde fiber est exécutée, il y a une valeur dans le canal, elle est obtenue, et l'exécution continue, d'abord avec la première fiber, puis avec la fiber principale,\nparce-que Fiber.yield place une fiber en fin de queue d'exécution.\nCanaux tamponnés (Buffered Channels)\nLes exemples précédents utilisent des canaux non tamponnés (unbuffered channels):\nlors de l'envoi d'une valeur, si une fiber est en attente sur ce canal alors l'exécution continue sur cette fiber.\nAvec un canal tamponné (buffered channel), l'appel de send ne basculera pas vers une autre fiber à moins que le tampon soit plein:\n# Un canal tamponné de capacité 2\nchannel = Channel(Int32).new(2)\n\nspawn do\n  puts \"Avant envoi 1\"\n  channel.send(1)\n  puts \"Avant envoi 2\"\n  channel.send(2)\n  puts \"Avant envoi 3\"\n  channel.send(3)\n  puts \"Après envoi\"\nend\n\n3.times do |i|\n  puts channel.receive\nend\n\nAffichage:\nAvant envoi 1\nAvant envoi 2\nAvant envoi 3\n1\n2\nAprès envoi\n3\nNotez que les deux premiers envois sont exécutés sans basculer vers une autre fiber.\nNéanmoins, dans le troisième envoi le tampon du canal est plein, alors l'exécution passe à la fiber principale.\nIci les deux valeurs sont reçues et le canal est épuisé. Au troisième receive la fiber principale bloque et l'exécution passe à l'autre fiber,\nqui envoie une autre valeur, finit, etc..\n"}}}
